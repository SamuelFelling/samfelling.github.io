                                        <p class="lead">I am currently in my fourth year at the University of Minnesota Duluth, majoring in Communications with a minor in Marketing. Alongside my coursework, I work as a server at Sammy’s Pizza in West Duluth, where I’ve gained valuable experience in customer service, teamwork, and communication.

                                        Outside of school and work, I enjoy spending time with friends and following sports — a passion that motivates my long-term career goals. After graduating in the spring of 2026, I hope to pursue a position in sports marketing where I can combine my academic background, creativity, and love for sports.</p>

My favorite professional teams are the Minnesota Vikings, Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Florida Gators. I especially enjoy playing hockey and basketball, which allow me to stay active, compete, and stay connected with friends.
