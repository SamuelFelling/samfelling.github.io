    <h1>Discover — UMD & Duluth</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Why I chose the University of Minnesota Duluth</h2>
      <p>I initially chose the University of Minnesota Duluth because many of my friends were attending. Even though I no longer live with any of them, I’ve formed great friendships with new roommates and classmates. One of the strongest qualities of UMD is the sense of community — being a smaller school makes it easier to build close connections and meet a large portion of students in your class.</p>

      <h2>What I like about Duluth</h2>
      <p>I also appreciate Duluth’s location. While I’m not someone who spends a lot of time outdoors, I still enjoy how much the city has to offer. Whether you’re spending time in Canal Park, visiting the mall, or exploring the area, there’s always something to do. Duluth has a unique atmosphere that makes living here enjoyable.</p>

      <h2>Personal experiences</h2>
      <p>Some of my favorite experiences at UMD include going to the bar with friends and playing intramural sports like basketball and hockey. Since UMD is a big hockey school, I also enjoy going to games at Amsoil Arena and supporting the team. I appreciate the variety of food options on campus as well — having a block plan the past few years has helped me save money while keeping meals convenient.</p>
