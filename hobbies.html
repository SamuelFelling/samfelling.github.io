      <p>Sports play a major role in my life, whether I’m watching games or playing with friends. My favorite professional teams are the Minnesota Vikings, Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Florida Gators. I especially enjoy playing hockey and basketball, which allow me to stay active, compete, and stay connected with friends. Sports are important to me because they keep me healthy, give me a way to challenge myself, and help me build strong friendships.</p>
